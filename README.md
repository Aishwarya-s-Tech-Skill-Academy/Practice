## 5. Set Branch protection rules
Generally we do not commit directly to the main or the master branch while working on projects. So we create a feature branch for that purpose. For example - dev, ut, Stage, main and prod for different stages of development life cycle. So for that purpose we add 'Branch Protection Rules' so that no one can directly commit to the main branch and changes are reviewed in a proper manner before merging it with the main branch and final production branch.

For creating a branch protection rule: Go to your repo -> Settings -> Branches -> Add Branch Protection rule -> give a name to your branch -> Check 'Require a pull request before merging' -> Set the number of required approvals -> Merge method as 'Squash and Merge' -> Check 'Do not allow bypassing the above settings' -> Create

## 6. Create a new project using board in the organization
We can create projects for tracking all the work done. We can choose from different available templates or start from scratch. There are 3 options available for creating new project: Table, Board, Roadmap.
Go to your organization -> Projects -> New Project -> Board -> Create
